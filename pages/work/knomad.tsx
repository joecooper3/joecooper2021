          Knomad needed a B2B e-commerce site to help make its vibrant,
          high-quality fibers stand out from its peers. I led the development of
          a WooCommerce site that allowed customers to easily discover and order
          yarn via a number of taxonomies you'd only ever encounter if you were
          the type to buy wholesale yarn. The site was created using a more
          traditional WooCommerce tech stack, including PHP, SCSS, and vanilla
          JavaScript.
