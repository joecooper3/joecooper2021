          As part of Visible's Phonetopia event, our dev team was tasked with
          creating a host of tech-y activations. My assignment was to program an
          arcade game about receiving too many text messages. The game supported
          up to four players and connected to a central external database to
          help display high scores at different screens at the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game was built with Phaser.js and transformed into a Windows app
          via Electron. To get things booted up on that arcade unit pictured
          below, I had to write some Bash scripts for whatever version of
          Windows the cabinet used under the hood.
