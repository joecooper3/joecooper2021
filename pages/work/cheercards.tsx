          The TCS New York City Marathon wanted to find a way to encourage
          friends and family to support their runners; enter the Cheer Cards. I
          helped develop a mobile app that allowed users to upload, edit, and
          tag photos to cheer on their loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the user-generated images were sufficiently plastered with
          colorful stickers, messages, and frames, they were uploaded and
          integrated into TCS's existing runner database. Chips in the runners'
          racing bibs triggered nearby billboards to display Cheer Cards created
          by their supporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app was built with React, Redux, Konva.js, and used WordPress on
          the back end.
